# Generic Method Patterns in AL

## Overview

Generic Method Patterns in AL enable type-safe, reusable code by allowing methods to work with different data types while maintaining compile-time type checking. These patterns reduce code duplication and provide flexible, maintainable solutions for common algorithmic operations.

**Key Benefit**: Enables creation of type-safe, reusable algorithms that work across different data types while maintaining performance and compile-time validation.

## Core Generic Concepts

### Type Parameter Definition
Define generic type parameters in method signatures that can represent any compatible type, enabling flexible method implementation.

### Constraint Specification
Apply constraints to generic type parameters to ensure they meet specific requirements for the generic algorithm implementation.

### Type Inference
Leverage AL's type inference capabilities to reduce explicit type specification while maintaining type safety in generic method calls.

## Essential Generic Patterns

### Collection Processing Generics
Implement generic methods for common collection operations such as filtering, mapping, and reduction that work across different data types.

### Comparison and Sorting Generics
Design generic comparison and sorting algorithms that can work with any comparable data type while maintaining efficiency.

### Data Transformation Generics
Create generic transformation methods that can convert between different data types using consistent transformation patterns.

## Advanced Generic Techniques

### Multi-Type Parameter Methods
Design methods with multiple generic type parameters that can handle complex operations involving multiple related types.

### Generic Factory Methods
Implement generic factory patterns that can create instances of different types based on generic parameters and runtime conditions.

### Generic Event Handlers
Create generic event handling patterns that can process events with different payload types using consistent handling logic.

## Type Safety Strategies

### Constraint-Based Validation
- Use generic constraints to ensure type parameters meet specific interface or inheritance requirements
- Implement compile-time validation for generic type compatibility
- Design constraint hierarchies that support complex type requirements
- Provide clear error messages for constraint violations

### Runtime Type Checking
- Implement runtime type validation for scenarios where compile-time checking is insufficient
- Support dynamic type discovery and validation in generic methods
- Handle type conversion and casting safely within generic implementations
- Provide fallback mechanisms for unsupported type scenarios

## Performance Optimization

### Generic Method Specialization
Implement specialized versions of generic methods for commonly used types to optimize performance while maintaining generic interface compatibility.

### Type-Specific Optimizations
Design generic methods that can apply type-specific optimizations based on runtime type information while maintaining consistent interfaces.

### Memory Efficiency
Optimize memory usage in generic methods by avoiding unnecessary object creation and implementing efficient type-specific storage patterns.

## Integration Patterns

### Interface-Based Generics
Design generic methods that work with interfaces, enabling polymorphic behavior while maintaining type safety and flexibility.

### Generic Extension Methods
Implement extension methods using generic patterns to add functionality to existing types without modification.

### Generic Builder Patterns
Create generic builder patterns that can construct complex objects of different types using consistent building interfaces.

## Error Handling and Validation

### Generic Exception Patterns
Design exception handling patterns that work effectively with generic methods while providing meaningful error information.

### Type Validation Strategies
Implement comprehensive type validation that ensures generic methods receive compatible types and handle edge cases appropriately.

### Constraint Violation Handling
Handle constraint violations gracefully with clear error messages and appropriate fallback behaviors.

## Testing Generic Methods

### Parameterized Testing
- Design test patterns that validate generic method behavior across multiple type parameters
- Implement property-based testing for generic algorithms
- Support type-specific test scenarios while maintaining generic test structure
- Validate constraint enforcement and error handling

### Type Coverage Testing
- Ensure test coverage across all supported generic type parameters
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions for different types
- Validate performance characteristics across different type parameters
- Test integration scenarios with complex generic method compositions

## Best Practices

### Design Principles
- Keep generic methods focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful names for generic type parameters
- Implement appropriate constraints to ensure type safety
- Provide clear documentation for generic method usage and constraints

### Performance Guidelines
- Consider the performance implications of generic method implementation
- Use specialized implementations for performance-critical scenarios
- Minimize boxing and unboxing operations in generic methods
- Profile generic method performance with different type parameters

## Common Pitfalls

### Over-Generalization
Avoid creating overly generic methods that become complex and difficult to understand or maintain.

### Constraint Misuse
Prevent inappropriate use of generic constraints that unnecessarily limit method applicability or create confusing type requirements.

### Performance Degradation
Be aware of potential performance impacts from generic method overhead, especially in high-frequency scenarios.
