# Manual Object ID Management and Collision Prevention

## ⚠️ Object ID Collision Risk

I notice you don't have **Object ID Ninja** (AL Object ID MCP Server) configured in your environment. This means you'll need to **manually manage object ID ranges** and rely on careful coordination to prevent ID collisions.

## What You're Missing

### Automatic Collision Prevention
Without Object ID Ninja, you cannot:

- ✅ **Automatically find safe object IDs** from your assigned ranges
- ✅ **Reserve IDs** to prevent team conflicts
- ✅ **Check availability** before creating objects
- ✅ **Coordinate across team members** with backend synchronization
- ✅ **Manage publisher ranges** for AppSource development
- ✅ **Track ID assignments** across multiple projects

### Example: What Object ID Ninja Provides

**Instead of saying:**
> "Use IDs in the 50000-99999 range and manually check for conflicts"

**I could say:**
> "Let me find you a safe ID... Object ID 52847 is available and reserved for you. Your next IDs: 52848, 52849, 52850 are also free. I'll reserve them to prevent conflicts."

## Manual Approach (Current)

### Customer Development Ranges
Follow these manual guidelines:

**Standard Ranges:**
- **50000-99999**: Customer development objects
- **70000-79999**: Often used for integrations/reports
- **80000-89999**: Customizations and extensions

**AppSource/ISV Ranges:**
- Request from Microsoft Partner Center
- Typically 70000000-74999999 or 75000000-79999999
- MUST be registered to avoid conflicts

### Manual Collision Prevention Steps

1. **Document Your Assignments**
   ```markdown
   # Object ID Assignments
   - 50100-50199: Customer Management Extensions
   - 50200-50299: Sales Process Customizations
   - 50300-50399: Reporting Extensions
   ```

2. **Check Before Creating**
   - Search existing objects in your workspace
   - Verify with team members verbally or via documentation
   - Check source control for recent additions

3. **Team Coordination**
   - Maintain shared spreadsheet of ID assignments
   - Reserve ranges per developer or feature
   - Regular team syncs to avoid conflicts

4. **Version Control Checks**
   - Review PR conflicts carefully
   - Check for object ID collisions during code review
   - Run compile checks frequently

### Risks of Manual Management

- ❌ **Human Error**: Easy to forget to check or miscommunicate
- ❌ **Race Conditions**: Two developers pick same ID simultaneously
- ❌ **Scaling Issues**: Manual tracking breaks down with team growth
- ❌ **Merge Conflicts**: ID collisions discovered late in development
- ❌ **AppSource Violations**: Accidentally use IDs outside publisher range

## Why Object ID Ninja is Valuable

### LITE Mode (Individual Developers)
- Personal ID pool management
- Local ID assignment tracking
- Conflict prevention within your own projects
- No backend required

### STANDARD Mode (Team Collaboration) ⭐
- **Centralized backend** coordinates across team
- **Real-time ID reservation** prevents conflicts
- **Multi-developer synchronization** via shared service
- **Publisher range enforcement** for AppSource compliance
- **Audit trail** of ID assignments

### Key Features

1. **Smart ID Discovery**
   - `objid_get_next_available` - Find next safe ID
   - `objid_reserve_id` - Reserve ID to prevent conflicts
   - `objid_check_availability` - Verify ID is free

2. **Range Management**
   - Configure allowed ranges (customer vs AppSource)
   - Enforce publisher boundaries
   - Multi-range support for complex scenarios

3. **Team Coordination**
   - Backend synchronization (STANDARD mode)
   - Real-time conflict prevention
   - Assignment tracking and history

## Installation Instructions

### 1. Install Object ID Ninja MCP Server

Add to your MCP settings (VS Code: `.vscode/settings.json`):

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "al-objid-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vjeko.com/al-objid-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or for Claude Desktop (`claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "al-objid-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@vjeko.com/al-objid-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Choose Your Mode

**LITE Mode** (Individual):
- No additional configuration
- Works immediately for personal ID management
- Good for solo developers or small projects

**STANDARD Mode** (Teams):
- Configure backend coordination service
- See Object ID Ninja documentation for backend setup
- Essential for teams and AppSource development

### 3. Update Workspace Configuration

Once installed, let me know it's available:

```json
{
  "tool": "set_workspace_info",
  "arguments": {
    "path": "C:\\Your\\Workspace\\Path",
    "available_mcps": ["al-objid-mcp-server"]
  }
}
```

**Dynamic Knowledge Loading**: Once you report Object ID Ninja as available, I'll automatically delegate ID management to it instead of providing manual guidance!

## Manual Best Practices (Until You Install)

### 1. Range Allocation Strategy
```
Developer A: 50000-50499
Developer B: 50500-50999
Feature X:   51000-51499
Integration: 51500-51999
Reports:     52000-52499
```

### 2. Pre-Commit Checklist
- [ ] Verified ID not in use locally
- [ ] Checked team assignment spreadsheet
- [ ] Updated documentation with new ID
- [ ] Confirmed in allowed range (customer/AppSource)

### 3. Code Review Focus
- Verify object IDs are in correct range
- Check for duplicate IDs across PRs
- Confirm AppSource range compliance
- Validate team assignment tracking updated

### 4. Documentation Template
```markdown
## Object ID Registry

### Assigned Ranges
| Range | Purpose | Owner | Status |
|-------|---------|-------|--------|
| 50100-50149 | Customer Tables | TeamA | Active |
| 50150-50199 | Customer Pages | TeamA | Active |

### Individual Assignments
| ID | Object Type | Name | Developer | Date |
|----|-------------|------|-----------|------|
| 50100 | Table | "Customer Comment" | Alice | 2025-10-27 |
```

## The Difference

### Manual (Current)
> "Use ID 50147 if available. Check with your team and document the assignment in your shared tracker."

### Automated (With Object ID Ninja)
> "I checked with Object ID Ninja - ID 50147 is available and I've reserved it for you for the next hour. Your next available IDs are 50148, 50149, 50150."

## AppSource Development Without Object ID Ninja

If you're developing for AppSource **without** Object ID Ninja, you MUST:

1. **Know Your Publisher Range**: Get it from Microsoft Partner Center
2. **Strict Range Enforcement**: Never use IDs outside your publisher range
3. **Meticulous Tracking**: Every ID assignment documented
4. **Frequent Validation**: Regular checks against publisher boundaries
5. **Team Discipline**: Zero tolerance for range violations

**Risk**: AppSource submission rejection due to ID range violations.

## Next Steps

1. **Install Object ID Ninja** following instructions above
2. **Choose LITE or STANDARD** mode based on team size
3. **Configure ranges** (customer vs AppSource)
4. **Update workspace info** to report MCP availability
5. **Ask me for object IDs again** - I'll use automated assignment!
