# API Interface Design Patterns

## Overview

API Interface Design Patterns provide proven approaches for creating maintainable, extensible, and user-friendly API contracts. These patterns ensure APIs remain stable while supporting evolution and provide clear contracts for consumers.

**Key Benefit**: Creates predictable, maintainable API contracts that support long-term evolution without breaking existing consumers.

## Core Design Principles

### Interface Segregation
Design focused interfaces that serve specific purposes rather than monolithic interfaces that attempt to handle all scenarios.

### Contract Stability
Maintain backward compatibility through careful interface evolution strategies and versioning approaches.

### Consumer-Centric Design
Design interfaces from the consumer perspective, optimizing for common usage patterns and developer experience.

## Essential Interface Patterns

### Command-Query Separation
Separate interfaces for operations that modify state (commands) from those that retrieve data (queries), enabling clearer contracts and better optimization opportunities.

### Fluent Interface Pattern
Design method chaining interfaces that enable expressive, readable API usage while maintaining type safety and clear operation sequencing.

### Builder Interface Pattern
Implement builder-style interfaces for complex object construction scenarios where multiple optional parameters need to be specified.

## Versioning and Evolution Strategies

### Additive Interface Evolution
Design interfaces to support evolution through additive changes that don't break existing consumers while enabling new functionality.

### Interface Composition
Use interface composition to build complex API contracts from smaller, focused interface components that can evolve independently.

### Deprecation Patterns
Implement clear deprecation strategies that provide migration paths for consumers while enabling interface evolution.

## Advanced Interface Patterns

### Contextual Interface Adaptation
Design interfaces that adapt their behavior based on context (user permissions, feature flags, system configuration) while maintaining consistent contracts.

### Generic Interface Patterns
Use generic interfaces to provide type-safe operations across different data types while maintaining consistent operation patterns.

### Callback Interface Integration
Integrate callback interfaces for asynchronous operations and event handling while maintaining clear contract boundaries.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Parameter Design
- Use strongly-typed parameters with clear naming conventions
- Implement validation at interface boundaries
- Provide clear documentation for parameter requirements and constraints
- Consider parameter object patterns for complex method signatures

### Return Value Patterns
- Design consistent return value patterns across interface methods
- Use result objects for operations that can fail with detailed error information
- Implement null object patterns where appropriate to avoid null reference issues

## Best Practices

### Documentation Standards
- Provide comprehensive interface documentation with examples
- Document expected behaviors, side effects, and error conditions
- Include performance characteristics and usage guidelines
- Maintain versioning documentation for interface evolution

### Error Handling Design
- Design consistent error handling patterns across all interface methods
- Use typed exceptions or result objects for error communication
- Provide actionable error messages for consumers
- Implement proper error recovery guidance

## Common Pitfalls

### Interface Bloat
Avoid creating large interfaces that try to handle too many scenarios, making them difficult to implement and maintain.

### Breaking Changes
Prevent accidental breaking changes through careful interface evolution planning and comprehensive testing strategies.
